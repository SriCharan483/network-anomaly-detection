# network-anomaly-detection

Objective - With increasing cybersecurity threats, it's crucial to detect abnormal network traffic that may signal intrusions or attacks. The goal is to identify whether a network connection is normal or anomalous based on connection-level features 
To build and deploy a classification model that detects malicious network behavior in real time.

Target Metric
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, F1-Score for anomaly class
Deployment responsiveness

Key Insights from EDA
Most attacks occur via tcp and http.
Specific services like telnet and private have high anomaly rates.
Duration and wrong_fragment features are strong indicators.
